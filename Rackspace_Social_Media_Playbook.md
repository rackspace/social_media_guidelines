# Rackspace Social Media Playbook & Guide
Rackspace Simple Social Media Guide for Engineers, Rackers and the world!

We want Rackers to publicly share their awesome stories and skills. We want
your experiences in devops, tales of MacGyver-esque engineering, info about
little known cool new features we've deployed to production, your contribution
to awesome open source work or anything you can think of. We want to increase
external communication and collaboration and we need you to be involved.

When we say "social media" we mean Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Google+, Stack
Overflow, etc. We've released this guidebook for *you* and the community as a
whole: changes, updates and feedback are always welcome.

**But I am [your name here] and I can say whatever the heck I want!**

Well, that is true, but Rackspace has (and you should have) a few guidelines,
that when applied will make it a lot easier for everyone involved (the public,
fellow Rackers, the SEC). We want you to be shown in the best light possible.
When you look good, Rackspace looks good.

We've categorized these into two buckets: **Racker Values** and **Hard and Fast
Rules**.

1. **Hard and Fast Rules** mean that all of us will have legal problems, and
   potentially run afoul of the SEC.
2. **Racker Values** are tied to our core values and represent the values and
   ideals we wish to present to the world.


## Hard and Fast Rules

1. Avoid mentioning our stock or using *RAX* in anything public.

   Since *RAX* is our stock ticker symbol, legally speaking, what you can or
   can't talk about becomes a gray area pretty quickly (even if your profile is private). 
   What is or isn't public and how people will take what you say is never a certain thing; it could be
   a huge headache for everyone involved. Not talking about the stock is really
   the best course of action for everyone. RackLaw is busy enough fighting
   patent trolls and the last thing they want to do is to deal with a call from
   the SEC.

2. If a competitor is experiencing an outage, leave it alone.

   Don't taunt them or tell the world how great we are - our promoters always
   go to bat for us. We get angry when people poke at us and try to steal
   customers during outages, so we shouldn't do it either. We need to be the
   example of professionalism when it comes to scenarios like this, otherwise
   it will bite us in the ass when we have an outage.

   This also applies to open source contributions by other companies.  Another
   company might open source a project that we disagree with for some reason
   (poor performance, terrible security, unmaintainable code) but there are
   many ways to approach it to be constructive rather than condescending or
   argumentative.

3.  Don't let your desire to help lead to divulging trade secrets or committing
    to performance promises.

    Please, never talk about customers or partners unless you are certain it is
    public information, and even then *triple check it*. Things could go
    terribly for us if we slip up. help@rackspace.com is your *friend* - ask
    them - they probably have the answer.

   Any specific numbers/processes that could be useful to the community should
   be whipped up into a blog post but we should be careful to vet this
   information with the help of other Rackers: the social media team at
   @Rackspace or help@rackspace.com would be delighted to help for articles
   headed to the official Rackspace blog. Likewise, the DevOps blog editors are
   champing at the bit to steward your technical articles out to the world. We
   want to help you let everyone know how cool the stuff you do is, and we
   don't want legal to get angry at any of us or be sad.

## Racker Values

1. Be as helpful as possible.

   We were all beginners at one point, and "RTFM" and "man strace" were neither
   helpful nor constructive answers. If that's all you have to contribute, stop
   and get help, or refer it to help@rackspace.com. Be kind, constructive, and
   informative in your responses. *Remember*: It doesn't cost anything to give
   the other person the benefit of the doubt.

2. Let everyone know you are a Racker.

   We should be proud to work here and we never want it to look like we are
   hiding our affiliation. Fanatical Support (you know, what we sell) is a team
   effort anyway, so publicizing your relationship with Rackspace will also
   allow you - if necessary - to call in Racker reinforcements without
   confusing the public.

3. Be yourself: do what you love and do it well.

   If you want to host the worlds largest dubstep (we don't judge) fan site, do
   it like *you mean it*. However, don't let your passion turn you into a
   raving jerk. It is easy to get caught up in a debate, be the better human,
   it works out in the long term. If you can't let something go, be persuasive
   with substance, not combative. Walk away, think about it for a while.
   *Remember*: While a customer or user's perception may be subjective, it’s
   still very real and should be respected.

4. Be a useful part of the conversation.

    Avoid arguing with people. Instead, provide well thought out constructive
    suggestion, with references if possible.


5. Agree to disagree.

   Sure, winning an argument or proving that you're right might give you an
   ego-boost, but it doesn't mean you won't come off looking like a jerk.
   Invite folks to a private conversation and agree to disagree if you must.
   Nobody likes arrogance or condescension; except trolls.

6. *Don't be a troll.*

7. Be willing to admit when you're wrong.

   None of us are perfect. Owning up to mistakes will give you more credibility
   and people will value your opinion more.

8. "Oops, this looks bad."

   If a situation arises that you don't know how to handle or you think you
   might have just done something terrible, let our friends on the Social
   Support team help - DM @Rackspace on Twitter or email help@rackspace.com
   right away. Getting in front of something or having a little guidance is
   good for all of us (the Social Support team literally watches social
   networks 24 hours a day).

9. Share information and ideas and ask for help.

   We all curate lists of friends with great skill sets - use those
   relationships and reciprocate in kind. If you are having a problem that can
   be abstracted not to give away any specific secret information, talk about
   it and find the best solution.

10. Don't "astroturf".

   We actively discourage all forms "astroturfing" online. Do not up vote,
   retweet, +1, like, etc. in online forums unless you - as a Racker and
   individual - find that the material is of merit, interest and value.

11. Get out there and be public.

   *You make your own name*. Rackspace can give you the environment, support,
   and tools to do amazing things but it is up to you to put them to use and
   share that experience with the world. It helps us all when you get out there
   and have a positive impact in communities and user groups. Never be afraid
   to interact - just be mindful of how you do it and ask for help when you
   need it.

12. Think before you tweet or post.

   Have some situational awareness - before posting a picture to instagram of
   your awesome team outing at the bar, think about how that could be perceived
   by customers who are in the middle of a crisis. Outages aren't just
   widespread things that affect all customers. They can also include isolated
   problems that affect a handful of customers, which are just as real and
   disruptive. The last thing they want to see or hear about is your awesome
   outing during a disruption.
